To enhance the precision of predicting active COVID-19 cases through machine learning, it's advisable to incorporate a broad range of data types. This includes demographic information such as population density and age distribution, environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and air quality, as well as metrics related to health infrastructure, such as the number of hospitals and healthcare expenditures. Additionally, data on mobility and connectivity, encompassing mobility patterns and public transportation usage, can offer valuable insights into the virus's potential spread. It's also crucial to consider policy measures, including government interventions, mask mandates, and vaccination rates, along with social and behavioral data like public compliance with guidelines and the impact of awareness campaigns.
